# Summary
`IDCeMPy` is a free, open-source and versatile Python package that enables
researchers to easily fit three distinct sets of inflated discrete choice models that
are often used in a variety of disciplines including Economics, Business, Engineering, Political
Science, Psychology, and Public Health: (i) Zero-Inflated Ordered Probit (ZIOP), (ii)
Middle-Inflated Ordered Probit (MIOP), and (iii) Generalized Inflated Multinomial
Logit (GIMNL) models. While the ZIOP model [@harris2007zero] permits careful evaluation 
of zero-inflated ordered choice outcomes that results from two data generating
processes (hereafter, “d.g.p’s”), the MIOP model [@bagozzi2012mixture]
accounts for ordered choice outcomes in which the inflated middle-category emerges 
from distinct d.g.p’s. The GIMNL models [@bagozzi2017distinguishing] account for the large proportion—and heterogeneous
mixture—of observations in the baseline and other unordered outcome
categories within MNL models that evaluate multiple unordered polytomous
outcomes.

`IDCeMPy` is currently intended to be used by researchers in social, behavioral,
and natural sciences, and by data scientists working with inflated discrete choice
outcome variables. Its clean, easy to use Python code is well-tested and well-
documented. For further details, the reader is referred to the official `IDCeMPy`
repository.

# Statement of Need
Scholars and Data Scientists often use discrete choice models to evaluate
ordered outcomes using the ordered probit model and unordered polytomous
measures via the multinomial logit (MNL) estimator. These models, however,
cannot account for the fact that in many ordered and unordered polytomous
choice situations, an excessive share of observations—stemming from two
distinct d.g.p’s—fall into a single category which is thus “inflated.” For instance,
ordered outcome measures of self-reported smoking behavior that range from 0
for “no smoking” to 3 for “smoking 20 cigarettes or more daily” contain excessive
observations in the zero (no smoking) category that includes two types of 
non-smokers: individuals who never smoke cigarettes, and those who smoked
previously but temporarily stopped smoking because of their high price
[@harris2007zero; @greene2015inflated].

In ordered choice measures such as immigration attitudes, it is the 
middle-category of “indifference” that is inflated since it includes respondents who are
truly indifferent about immigration and those who select “indifference” because of
social desirability reasons [@bagozzi2012mixture; @brown2020modelling].
Further, in unordered polytomous variables of vote choice, for example, the
baseline category is frequently inflated as it includes non-voters who abstain from
voting in an election owing to temporary factors and routine non-voters who are 
disengaged from the political process [@campbell2008religion; @bagozzi2017distinguishing]. 
Failing to account for such category inflation in
discrete choice measures leads to model misspecification, biased estimates, and
incorrect inferences.

@dale2018estimation's `ZiOP` STATA command fits the Zero-Inflated Ordered
Probit without correlated errors, while @xia2019gidm's `digm` STATA command
fits discrete choice models without correlated errors for inflated zero and other
lower-category discrete outcomes. In contrast, `IDCeMPy` is a comprehensive
Python package that offers researchers the possibility of estimating and
assessing the performance of inflated ordered probit models with and without
correlated errors, the Middle-Inflated Ordered Probit with and without correlated errors,
and inflated MNL models. `IDCeMPy` entirely depends on [Python](https://www.python.org/) standard libraries such as 
`NumPy`, `pandas`, and `SciPy`, allowing it to be easily extensible, flexible and efficient time-wise which facilitates efficient handling of large datasets.  It is compatible with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7+. 

# Package Architecture
`IDCeMPy` provides functions to fit the Zero-Inflated Ordered Probit (ZIOP) model
without and with correlated errors (ZIOPC model), and the Middle-Inflated
Ordered Probit (MIOP) model without and with correlated errors (MIOPC). These
models account for the inflated share of observations in either the zero or 
middle-category by combining a single binary “split-stage” probit equation with an
ordered probit “outcome-stage” equation. Users can treat the error terms from
these two equations as independent or correlated in the package’s estimation
routines. `IDCeMPy` also includes functions to fit Generalized Inflated MNL models
(GIMNL)—combining a logit split-stage equation, and a MNL outcome-stage
equation—to account for the preponderant and heterogeneous share of
observations in the baseline or other outcome categories in unordered
polytomous outcome measures. Combining two probability distributions by
estimating two equations in each aforementioned model statistically addresses
the inflated share of observations in an ordered or unordered choice category
that results from distinct d.g.p’s. This ensures that each inflated discrete choice
model in `IDCeMPy` avoids model misspecification and provides accurate estimates
when evaluating inflated ordered and unordered polytomous dependent
variables. `IDCeMPy` also provides functions to assess each included model’s
goodness-of-fit, extract marginal effects, and conduct tests for model
comparison. 

The ZIOP(C) models developed by @harris2007zero and
@greene2010modeling can assess, for instance, zero-inflation in ordered outcome
measures of self-reported smoking behavior and accident injury-severity
outcomes [@fountas2018analysis]. In Public Health, Psychology and Biomedical
research, survey response outcomes including disease severity, perceived
depression level, or degree of pain are operationalized according to the None =
0, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, and Severe = 3 ordered scale. The lowest outcome
(None=0) of these ordered measures such as perceived depression level
typically include an excessive share of observations that emerge from two
subpopulations: one group that has never experienced depression, and a second
group that experienced clinical depression in the past but not during the
assessed time-period analyzed in the survey questionnaire. The Zero-Inflated Ordered 
Probit model incorporated in the `iopmod` and `iopcmod`functions in `IDCeMPy`
permits researchers to account for excessive zeros stemming from two
populations in ordered measures such as perceived levels of depression, 
which leads to more accurate estimates. The MIOP(C) models also estimated 
using the `iopmod` and `iopcmod` functions can address middle-category inflation in, for example,
ordered measures like monetary policy [@brown2020modelling] and attitudes
towards European Union (EU) membership [@bagozzi2012mixture].

Further, Multinomial Logit (MNL) models are applied to not just study vote choice
[@campbell2008religion; @bagozzi2017distinguishing], but to also assess
transportation choice, environmental policy, and consumer demand in health and
urban economics [@richards2018new]. For instance, transportation choice for
traveling to work by residents in large cities are often measured along the
following unordered polytomous scale: “subway train or bus”, “bicycles”,
“personal vehicle”, and “limousine.” The baseline category of this unordered
polytomous scale contains excessive observations generated from two
subpopulations: one group that uses subway trains or bus to save money, and
the second group who use public transportation to protect the environment since
using their personal vehicle contributes to pollution. Researchers can thus use 
the Baseline-Inflated MNL model [@bagozzi2017distinguishing] in the `imnlmod` 
function in IDCeMPy to account for excessive baseline category observations in unordered
polytomous measures which leads to accurate inferences.
